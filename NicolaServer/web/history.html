					<h2 class="first-h2">What is a User Story?</h2>
					<p>User stories originated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming" target="_blank">Extreme Programming (XP)</a>, whose first written description in 1998 only claimed that customers defined project scope "with user stories, which are like use cases". Rather than offered as a distinct practice, they were described as one of the "game pieces" used in the planning game. However, most of the further literature thrust around all the ways arguing that user stories are "unlike" use cases, in trying to answer in a more practical manner "how requirements are handled" in XP and more generally Agile projects. This drives the emergence, over the years, of a more sophisticated account of user stories.</p>
					<p>In 2001, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeffries" target="_blank">Ron Jeffries</a> proposed the well-known Three C's formula, i.e. Card, Conversation, Confirmation, to capture the components of a user story:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A Card (or often a Post-it note) is a physical token giving tangible and durable form to what would otherwise only be an abstraction;</li>
						<li>A Conversation is taking place at different time and places during a project between the various stakeholders concerned by the given feature (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.), which is largely verbal but most often supplemented by documentation;</li>
						<li>The Confirmation, the more formal the better, ensures that the objectives the conversation revolved around have been reached finally.</li>
					</ul>
