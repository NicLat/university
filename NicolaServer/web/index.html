How to use the simple framework:
You can build many rows and fill each one with different columns, the rule is that the sum of col width has to be 6.
So the options are: col6 or col3+col3 or col2+col2+col2 or col1+col2+col3.... every combination that is large 6.
Inside each column use a wrap to insert stuff.

						<p>User stories are short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="userstories-list"><span class="usphrase">As a</span> &lt;type of user>, <span class="usphrase">I want</span> &lt;some goal> <span class="usphrase">so that</span> &lt;some reason>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes, stored in a shoe box, and arranged on walls or tables to facilitate planning and discussion. As such, they strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them. In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.</p>

						<h2>Who writes User Stories?</h2>
						<p>Anyone can write user stories. It's the product owner's responsibility to make sure a product backlog of agile user stories exists, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the product owner is the one who writes them. Over the course of a good agile project, you should expect to have user story examples written by each team member.</p>
						<p>Also, note that who writes a user story is far less important than who is involved in the discussions of it.</p>

						<h2>When Are User Stories Written?</h2>
						<p>User stories are written throughout the agile project. Usually a story-writing workshop is held near the start of the agile project. Everyone on the team participates with the goal of creating a product backlog that fully describes the functionality to be added over the course of the project or a three- to six-month release cycle within it.</p>
						<p>Some of these agile user stories will undoubtedly be epics. Epics will later be decomposed into smaller stories that fit more readily into a single iteration. Additionally, new stories can be written and added to the product backlog at any time and by anyone.</p>

						<h2>Some User Stories examples?</h2>
						<p>One of the benefits of agile user stories is that they can be written at varying levels of detail. We can write a user story to cover large amounts of functionality. These large user stories are generally known as epics. Here is an epic agile user story example from a desktop backup product:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because an epic is generally too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on. The epic above could be split into dozens (or possibly hundreds), including these two:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.</li>
							<li>As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.</li>
						</ul>
